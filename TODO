# XXX cf "word" translations under "watchword" and "proverb" - what kind of
# link/ext is this?  {{trans-see|watchword}}

# XXX implement parsing {{ja-see-kango|xxx}} specially, see むひ

# XXX check use of sense numbers in translations (check "eagle"/English)

# XXX in Coordinate terms, handle bullet point titles like Previous:, Next:
# (see "ten", both Coordinate terms and Synonyms)

# XXX parse "alter" tags; see where they are used (they seem to be alternate

htmlgen: Improve sense/word lists
  - more even sizes of sublists (use intervals when appropriate)
  - group kanji etc by radical + strokes
htmlgen: include word prefixes in breadcrumbs
htmlgen: Implement better list page generation

htmlgen: form-of (and alt-of) links in generated html should look at
canonical form in addition to word - now many items with accents are
not properly linked

htmlgen: strange Categories non-disambiguated in: https://kaikki.org/dictionary/English/meaning/v/vo/volva.html#volva-noun

htmlgen: compound-of field of sense not displayed in generated html

htmlgen: implement support for redirects

htmlgen: render audio-ipa for audios

htmlgen: make search faster on slow links (split to deeper prefixes if large)

htmlgen: when looking for linkage references, also check canonical
word form

Word entires may be generated from entries like "Thesaurus:ar:make happy" that
are in a wrong language.  Check if they are referenced from somewhere and
maybe restrict generation to entries that are actually referenced.

Consider caching template expansions in an LRU cache.  Make sure
template arguments that can be accessed from Lua are considered
properly.  Cache must be reset per-page.  (Does DISPLAYPAGE break this?)

Check * at the end of some derived forms in wort/English/Noun (e.g., dropwort*)
  - it actually is in the original wikitext and is used as a reference symbol,
    with explanation at the end of the table
  - should probably just remove the *
  - check if there are other similar reference symbols and how common they are

Apparently the following is not parsed correctly:
{{ws sense|any of enclosing symbols "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}" etc.}}

Recognize and parse {{zh-dial|...}} in linkage, e.g., 鼎/Chinese
  - Variety = language (these are more like translation than synonyms)
  - Location = tags, parenthesized part separate tag?
  - Words may have Notes references, which may need to be parsed as senses
    (not clear how common they are with other words)

{{syn|...}} not properly handled in nested glosses, see frons/Latin
sense "the forehead, brow, front", search for "vultus"

In translations, should process {{trans-see|...}} (cf. "abound with",
the only translations are with {{trans-see|...}})

ख/Translingual/Letter: DEBUG: unhandled parenthesized prefix: (Devanagari script letters) अ,‎ आ,‎ इ,‎ ई,‎ उ,‎ ऊ,‎ ऋ,‎ ए,‎ ऐ,‎ ओ,‎ औ,‎ अं,‎ अः,‎ अँ,‎ क,‎ ख,‎ ग,‎ घ,‎ ङ,‎ च,‎ छ,‎ ज,‎ झ,‎ ञ,‎ ट,‎ ठ,‎ ड,‎ ढ,‎ ण,‎ त,‎ थ,‎ द,‎ ध,‎ न,‎ प,‎ फ,‎ ब,‎ भ,‎ म,‎ य,‎ र,‎ ल,‎ व,‎ श,‎ ष,‎ स,‎ ह,‎ त्र,‎ ज्ञ,‎ क्ष,‎ क़,‎ ख़,‎ ग़,‎ ज़,‎ झ़,‎ ड़,‎ ढ़,‎ ष़ <nowiki>[</nowiki><nowiki>]</nowiki> at ['ख']
- is nowiki broken in templates?  Perhaps core.py:_template_to_body should
  call preprocess_text for the template body?

Check:
can/English/Verb: ERROR: no language name in translation item: : ... at ['can']
can/English/Verb: ERROR: no language name in translation item: : -bil- (tr) (verbal infix) at ['can']

Make sure rtl (right-to-left) and ltr markers are properly inserted
and matched in words (including translations and linkages), even when
splitting them.

Implement better parsing of compound_of base.  There are over 135k
compound_of entries in Wiktionary, so this is common enough to care
about.

Use something similar to tr "note" detection in linkages (e.g.,
pitää/Finnish search +).  Also, the parenthesized tags in Derived
terms as subheadings are currently not handled.

Check strange and incorrectly processed category link in
अधिगच्छति/Sanskrit (I suspect this may be coding error in Wiktionary,
looks like the category has a nested link)

Fix parsing linkages for letters in scripts, see P/English/Number
  - longer sequences of characters
  - P/Latvian "burti:" prefix handled incorrectly (should be separate linkage)
  - P/Vietnamese first word incorrectly split (never split before semicolon)
  - P/Vietnamese multi-char names inside parentheses handled incorrectly
    (replace parentheses by comma? colon by comma?)
Handle " / " as a separator in linkages; see be/Faroese/related
(Latin-script letter names)

have/English/Translations/"to possess"/Arabic: have "- you have" at end of tr;

language/English has weird IPAs coming from qualifier (see

Add more sanity checks:
  - number of words extracted for a few major languages (English, Korean, Zulu)
  - number of extraction errors of various kinds
  - number of translations extracted for major languages
  - number of linkages extracted for major languages
  - number of suspicious linkages
  - number of suspicious alt-of/form-of
  - number of alt-of
  - number of form-of
  - number of IPAs
  - number of forms
  - number of inflection templates
  - number of non-disambiguated translations
  - number of non-disambiguated linkages
  - number of senses with tags
  - number of senses with topics

お茶/Japanese/Verb:
  - "ocha suru" as romanization, "suru" should not be there
  - "intransitive suru" gets into end of canonical form
  - stem and past are not correctly parsed
  - related terms are not correctly parsed - English goes into alt

Handle and remove right-to-left mark (and left-to-right mark) from titles,
forms, translations, linkages.  Add tag "right-to-left" where they were
present.  (Or should we keep the marks but still add tag?)

Fix support for DISPLAYTITLE - sets page default display title, which
would be useful.  Maybe extract too?  Note that this may prevent
caching templates/Lua calls.

Check "class II noun" and similar "note" in translations, cf. form desc,
define required tags/mappings

Consider improving romanization recognition in translation by
capturing strings inside <span class="tr [Latn]"> and never
interpreting such strings as English.  This would would probably hook
into clean_node().

Review handling of 0x200e (left-to-right mark) and 0x200f
(right-to-left mark) in linkages.  Also, what if only one is present?
cf. test_script5 in test_linkages.py

B/Portugues list of characters is broken

Synonyms are not collected from nested senses.  See cat/English/Noun
sense 1/1 "A domesticated species..."

Move hieroglyph conversion to postprocessing

婬/Japanese/Kanji/Definitions has a table that is not correctly handled,
and is being parsed as head form.

Handle (* Poetic.) and (** Antiquanted.) and */** at end of form, e.g.
камень/Russian

Check topics in word head, cf. अंगूठा/Hindi, which has (anatomy) in head
Fix parsing "wait on hand, foot and finger"/English head parsing
(comma splits related forms).  Maybe similar magic character kludge as we do
for linkages? No, that won't work here... maybe just merge standalone
parts that are comma-separated parts of the title to the previous entry
with a comma (as a pre-processing step after splitting?).  Inflection though
might be in any of the parts, but I think usually the first.
Also: "wait on someone hand, foot and finger"/English.
Ah, similar bug in alt-of/inflection-of parsing.

Translation lists missing a comma between translations are handled incorrectly.
See tree/English/Tr/Punjabi (both Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi).

Implement special case in parsing word head for paren desc:
"на (na) accusative, by"; see помножать/Russian

Something wrong in parsing آتي/Arabic "coming"

Fix parsing "or" separated alternatives in canonical forms?  Or is it broken?

Finish datautils.py:split_slashes and use it for translations/linkages/heads
  - warn when clearly ambigious
  - add more tests in test_utils.py

Which language should be used in translation when langcode and language in the
entry differ?  This is particularly an issue for Chinese.  Or should we treat
the second-level entries (e.g., Mandarin) as tags?

Change clean_value in clean.py to receive ctx.  Add "hieroglyphs" tag
if the string contains <hiero> tag.  (Or maybe this needs to go in
clean_node in page.py?  Or maybe these two should be merged?)

Why is extraction suddenly very slow?  Is it because topics are no
longer copied?

Handle Chinese usage examples better - separate Chinese (traditional,
simplified), Pinyin, translation.

Translations for Mandarin seem to have Chinese language but cmn code.
What is correct?

Improve audio file URL generation to handle redirects.  Options
include using Commons API to query the actual location or parsing
Commons dumps to extract redirects.  (Note that some files also seems
to have missing transcoded versions - probably about 0.1-0.5% of them)

Parse eumhun related forms (Korean) in more detail, particularly
separate romanization and hanja forms, e.g. 度/Korean

Collect RGB values and other similar data

XXX chinese glyphs, see 內
 - I'm getting dial-syn page does not exist in synonyms, but Wiktionary
   shows a big list of synonyms

Some Chinese words have weird /wiki.local/ in sounds, see: 屋
 - also in pronunciations, several IPAs are captured, but they are not
   annotated with dialect information
 - this page also has dial-syn warning in synonyms (also noted elsewhere)
 - in Japanese compounds, roman transliterations incorrectly go into tags
 - in Japanese, does it make sense to have most senses annotated with "kanji"?

Parse readings subsection in Japanese kanji characters, see 內
 - these are apparently pronunciations, but not IPA
 - perhaps these might be parsed as forms with "reading" tag and tag
   for the type of reading?

Korean kanji seem to have Phonetic hangeul in pronunciation sections, see 內
Parse Phonetic hangeul in Pronunciation section (see 死/Korean)
