# Data for heuristically determinining whether a table cell should actually
# be parsed as a table header instead.
#
# The base for this dict is first generated from debug message data with
# tools/languages_with_cells_as_headers_debug_extract.py, which is then pruned.
# Pruning basically involves looking at each line and determining whether
# it is actually a systematic header (in a table cell), or just a fluke.
# For example Romanian "superlative" is a fluke, because it is only
# found in Romanian in the article "superlativ"; the heuristic made the cells in
# the table with it a candidate header (candidate_hdr = True in inflection.py)
# because expand_hdr() did not return any error tags: it *looked* like a
# header, because "superlative" is used in headers.
#
# When pruning, delete obvious cases that do not need thinking about
# (for example all Egyptian entries); if there are any that *could* be,
# and need repetitive checking each time this file is regenerated and repruned,
# put the line in a comment for future pruners.
#
# Commented entry => rejected
# Deleted => rejected
# Uncommented => accepted
# If all entries in a language are commented, comment the whole language to
# prevent possible future false positives.
#
# When languages_with_cells_as_headers_debug_extract.py is used to regenerate
# this script, everything that is new or rejected will be commented (and
# rejected) unless explicitly uncommented.
